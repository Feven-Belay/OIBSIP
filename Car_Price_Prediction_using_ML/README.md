# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
The price of a car depends on various factors like the brand's goodwill, features, horsepower, mileage, and many more. Car price prediction is a significant research area in machine learning. This project aims to train a car price prediction model using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year the car was purchased
- `Selling_Price`: Price at which the car is being sold
- `Present_Price`: Current ex-showroom price of the car
- `Driven_kms`: Distance driven in kilometers
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel used by the car (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- `Selling_type`: Type of seller (Dealer/Individual)
- `Transmission`: Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners

## Project Steps

### 1. Download and Load the Dataset
### 2. Data Preprocessing
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 4. Feature Engineering
### 5. Split the Data
### 6. Train the Model
### 7. Model Evaluation
### 8. Save the Model
